# Doesn't work when after you enter your email and password another screens comes up (mostly it doesn't happen)

Feature: Login
    As a user
    I need to Login
    So I can save my resources and plans

@LoginScenario
Scenario Outline: Log into the application using the correct credentials
  Given I am on the Access2Justice website and I clicked the login tab
  When I set the 'email' '<email>' and click Next button
  When I set the 'password' '<password>' and click Sign In button
  Then I am redirected to home page and shown as signed in with username '<userName>'
  Then I log out
