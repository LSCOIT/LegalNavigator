It is a voluntary, confidential process where parties meet with a neutral third party, the mediator, who facilitates a negotiation. Mediation minimizes the investment of time and cost involved in resolving a dispute, and can occur before a lawsuit is ever filed or anytime between a complaint and trial.                                                                     The goals and objectives of Professional Mediators of Alaska are to:\n\nEducate the public about the benefits of mediation for the resolution of family,  business, and community conflicts\nProvide ongoing training opportunities for professional mediators\nPromote the profession of mediation\nEncourage collaboration among mediators and develop a statewide network of professional mediators\nPromote adherence to standards of practice among professional mediators",

Choosing the document depends on whether they agree on all issues:  ending the marriage how to divide marital property and debts, the parenting plan for minor children and child support.  If they agree it is called a dissolution case and if they disagree it is called a divorce.  A dissolution happens after both spouses file a petiton together stating how they want to address all issues.  The court holds a short hearing to go over the agreement and makes sure it meets all of the legal requirements.  A divorce happens after a longer process with paperwork from both sides.  The divorce is granted either by an agreement of the spouses or a judge's decision after a trial where each side argues their positions and provides supporting evidence.",

    "description": "If your case is not able to resolve by an agreement and you need a judge to decide the issues, you will need to choose the type of trial that you think is best after understanding the options. Two different types of trials - informal and formal - are available to resolve cases involving divorce, property and debt division, parenting arrangements, and child support, as well as modifications. Both people in the case can choose to have an informal trial where the judge will decide the issues in the divorce case.  There are special rules designed to make the trial process easier for people who are representing themselves in an informal trial.  The judge asks all of the questions so the spouses do not ask each other questions during the trial.  Both spouses can present whatever evidence they think is important for the judge to consider D100 do not need to follow the Rules of Evidence.  The spouses cannot make objections to testimony or to the evidence the other side introduces.  After the informal trial where the judge hears testimony and considers the evidence, the judge will make a decision. This is different than a formal trial where each side presents their side of the case by making arguments and presenting evidence, including witness testimony and exhibits.  The Rules of Evidence are in effect, and each side can make objections when the Rules of Evidence are violated.  There is a specific way that questioning witnesses happens, including the type of questions that are allowed.  Before deciding the type of trial you want, it is important to understand the options.",

When the trial is over, the judge issues final orders and the case is over. For example, in a divorce with property and children involved, the trial will result in final orders that grant the divorce, divide the marital property and debts, issue a parenting plan and a child support order.\nA hearing is a court proceeding where one or a few issues are decided usually on a temporary basis before the trial. Hearing are shorter than trials and may be as short as 15 minutes or as long as 2-3 hours. For example, a parent may file a motion for a temporary parenting plan for their child. The judge may hold a hearing and ask both parents to present their argument on what the child's living schedule should be until trial when the final parenting plan is ordered. After hearing from both parents and considering any evidence presented, the judge may order a temporary parenting plan. Hearings also occur when someone files a motion to modify a parenting plan or child support after a final judgment has been entered.  It is helpful to prepare for a trial or hearing to be able to communicate what you want and present your evidence.",

Hopefully he/she will follow the order and you won't need to go back to court.  If he or she does not cooperate, the next step is to let the court know by filing a motion. The type of motion depends on the specifics of what the court ordered and what the opposing party did or didn't do about following the order.

The court must issue a child support order when it decides a parenting plan ( the custody and visitation arrangement)  for a child in a case involving divorce, dissolution, or custody between unmarried parents.  The CSSD issues an order when one parent requests child support because the parents have split up and the parent taking care of the child(ren) wants the other parent to pay support for the child.  Sometimes a parent will have a CSSD support order and then file a custody case in court later.  If the court issues a child support order that is different from the CSSD order, the court’s child support order takes priority and replaces the CSSD order.",

    "description": "In Alaska, you can request that the court order one spouse to pay the other spouse a specific amount of money called spousal support (alimony).  There are two kinds of spousal support - reorientation and rehabilitation - and both are limited in duration.  Generally, the court prefers to do an unequal division of the marital property and debts than order spousal support which avoids keeping ex-spouses financially connected after the divorce.  Sometimes spousal support is ordered on a temporary basis before trial so that one spouse has enough money to live before the property and debt division is finalized.",

    "description": "In a family law case, it is great if the spouses or parents can reach an agreement about the issues.  The agreement can be about all of the issues or just some of them.  The case can start out as an uncontested case which means all issues are agreed when the case is filed.  The case can also start out as contested because the people don't agree or don't know whether they agree, but they later reach an agreement.  The people in the case need to write up the agreement and file it with the court.  The judge will have a hearing to make sure the agreement meets the legal requirements and issue a final order on the agreed issues.",
